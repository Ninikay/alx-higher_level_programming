# 0x01 Python - if/else, loops, functions

Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It's often used as a ‚Äúscripting language‚Äù for web applications. This means that it can automate specific series of tasks, making it more efficient. This project covers the loop statements if, else
