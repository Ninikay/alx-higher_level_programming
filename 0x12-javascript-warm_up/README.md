# 0x12 Javascript - Warm up üé¢

JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. This project covers the basics using JS

At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:

* How to run a Javascript script
* How to create variables and constants
* What are differences between var, const and let
* What are all the data types available in Javascript
* How to use the if, if ... else statements
* How to use comments
* How to affect values to variables
* How to use while and for loops
* How to use break and continue statements
* What is a function and how do you use functions
* What does a function that does not use any return statement return
* Scope of variables
* What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
* How to manipulate dictionary
* How to import a file
