# 0x15 Javascript - Web JQuery

JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. This project covers Jquery and DOM events

At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:

How to select HTML elements in Javascript

What are differences between ID, class and tag name selectors
How to modify an HTML element style

How to make a POST request with jQuery Ajax
How to listen/bind to DOM events
How to listen/bind to user events
